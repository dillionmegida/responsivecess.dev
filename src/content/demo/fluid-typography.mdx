import CodeFrame from "../../components/CodeFrame.astro"
import Info from "../../components/mdx/Info.astro"

```css
element {
  font-size: clamp(min, preferred, max);
}
```

This function allows you to create fluid responsive typography without any media queries. You can watch the YouTube tutorial below or the writter version after it.

import YouTube from "../../components/YouTube.astro"

When working with texts, you might want different `font-size`s for different screens. A good solution might be media queries:

```css
element {
  font-size: 3rem;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

What happens if you need to target more screen sizes? Now you need more media queries:

```css
element {
  font-size: 3rem;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

@media (max-width: 800px) {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

@media (max-width: 500px) {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

Instead of managing multiple breakpoints with media queries, you can use **fluid typography**. Fluid Typography refers to typography that scales as the screen size changes. To achieve this, you can use viewport units:

```css
element {
  font-size: 10vw;
}
```

We have the `font-size` as "10% of the viewport width". When the viewport is 1000px, the `font-size` is **100px**. When the viewport is 50px, the `font-size` is **5px**.

Try resizing the iframe below and see how the paragraph scales:

```html
<p>Some text</p>
```

```css
p {
  font-size: 10vw;
}
```

<CodeFrame
  html={`<p>Some text</p>`}
  css={`
    p {
      font-size: 10vw;
    }
  `}
/>

This is fluid typography. As the screen goes wider, the `font-size` grows. And vice versa for when the width gets smaller. But there's a problem. Because we do not have a minimum and a maximum in the fluidness. So when the iframe is large, the text is large, and when the iframe is very small, the text is also very small. This is where `clamp` comes in.

With clamp, we have same fluid typography, but with a boundary--the minimum and maximum value:

```css
p {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 10vw, 5rem);
}
```

Now try resizing the iframe horizontally again:

<CodeFrame
  html={`<p>Some text</p>`}
  css={`
    p {
      font-size: clamp(2rem, 10vw, 5rem);
    }
  `}
/>

What you notice is that, if the viewport width goes smaller, the text never gets less than `2rem`. And if the viewport width goes wider, the text never goes beyond `5rem`. With `clamp`, we have created boundaries for the fluid font-size.

If you go back to observe the iframe, you'd see that the font-size stops reducing at **320px** and it stops increasing at **800px**. Let's do some calculation to explain these numbers.

Let's say we have a base of **16px** for **1rem**. That means, **2rem** is **32px** and **5rem** is **80px**.

The preferred size we have in the `clamp` function is **10vw**. When the viewport width is **800px**, **10vw** translates to **80px**, which is the `max` in our `clamp`. This means that when the viewport width becomes **801px** or more, our `font-size` stays clamped at **80px**, which is **5rem**.

The same idea applies to when the viewport width is **320px**. At this point, **10vw** translates to **32px**, which is the `min` in our `clamp`. Therefore, when the viewport width becomes **319px** or less, our `font-size` stays clamped at **32px**, which is **2rem**.

Hope this calculation helps? ðŸ˜…

This is how the `clamp` function allows us to create fluid typography with boundaries.
